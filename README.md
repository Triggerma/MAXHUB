# Max Hub
MaxHub is my personal script hub.


Max Hub currently supports:

Juke's Towers of Hell: https://www.roblox.com/games/8562822414/Jukes-Towers-of-Hell

Obby that gets harder everytime someone wins: https://www.roblox.com/games/7139216012/Obby-that-gets-harder-everytime-someone-wins

Natural Disaster Survival: https://www.roblox.com/games/189707/Natural-Disaster-Survival


Script: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cistuff/MAXHUB/main/MAXHUB.lua", true))()

I am currently working on a seperate UI that does not auto-detect what game you are in and has other generic scripts. This UI will include a UI for JToH. This UI will be automatically loaded when MaxHub is executed in a game that is not supported by MaxHub.

Script for the seperate UI: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cistuff/MAXHUB/main/MAXHUB_CUSTOM.lua", true))()


Other scripts related to Max Hub:

Script for JToH UI: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cistuff/MAXHUB/main/JTOH.lua", true))()
